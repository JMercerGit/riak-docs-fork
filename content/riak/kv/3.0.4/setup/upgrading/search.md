As of Riak KV 3.0.1, Riak Search (yokozuna) is no longer supported. However, using mapreduce in combination with 2i can produce similar, if not more powerful results.

For any questions reach out to the [Riak community]({{<baseurl>}}community). Preferably, ask your questions up front rather than during the middle of a migration.
